To run this project you have **two options**:

- ‚úÖ **Option A:** Use a pre-configured test account  
- ‚úÖ **Option B:** Set up your own SendGrid credentials (recommended for full functionality)

---

## ‚úÖ Option A: Use the Provided Test Account

You can use a built-in test account for immediate access without configuring SendGrid:

- **Email:** `test@user.com`  
- **Password:** `Testpassword1!`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è MFA email delivery will not function when using this account unless SendGrid credentials are also configured (see Option B). This is provided primarily for UI access and testing workflows.

---

## üîß Option B: Use Your Own SendGrid API Key (for MFA to Work)

To enable full MFA functionality, including receiving a verification code via email, you must use your own **SendGrid API key** and **verified sender email**.
